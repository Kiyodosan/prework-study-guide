# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to help coding students understand the basics of web development. It was written in a way that formats coding notes with the intention of being read and understood within a quick glance. It helps answer FAQs that students may come across throughout their coding journey. Writing the study guide gave me a different perspective of how coding is taught, as it is done differently, depending on who's teaching. As a result, I learned a unique way of writing and formatting code.
